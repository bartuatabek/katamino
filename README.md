### Project Description
As group Optimus Prime, we have the software implementation of classic Katamino game with added features in this repository. 

### Original Game
Katamino is a puzzle/stratagy game that consists of 12 different blocks, which are constructed from 5 smaller cubes. The gameboard has a movable divider, that creates the areas to be filled with blocks. The goal is to use the specified blocks for each level fill the rectangle under the divider. These areas can take 4 to 12 blocks to be filled depending on the pozition of the divider.
In the multiplayer mode of the game, 2 to 3 players take turns to place a block on to the gameboard. The first player that fails to place a block on the board loses the game.
 
 ### Katamino 2.0 ( Our project may the change name)
 In our project, we plan to implement the original Katamino game with some added features and increase difficulty. This version of Katamino, consists of more levels and more blocks. In order to increase difficulty, each level also has a time limit so, player has to hurry up. Every level comes with hints and a solution, these hints and solutions are available if and only if player successfully completes certain levels. There is multi-player option as well. In the multiplayer version, players take turns to place blocks in a rectangle area, the first player that fails to place a block to the rectangle area (due to the size or shape of the blocks) looses the game. The game also includes a high score board where players are placed with respect to their best times in each level.
