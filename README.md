### Project Topic
As group Optimus Prime, we create and implement a new version of classical Katamino game. 

### Real Katamino Game Description
Katamino is a puzzle/strategy game that consists of 12 different blocks, which are constructed from 5 smaller cubes. The gameboard has a movable divider, that creates the areas to be filled with blocks. The goal is to use the specified blocks for each level fill the rectangle under the divider. These areas can take 4 to 12 blocks to be filled depending on the pozition of the divider.
In the multiplayer mode of the game, game is played with 2 to 3 players by taking turns to place a block to a square gameboard that contains 64 smaller squares. The first player who fails to place a block on the board anymore loses the game.
 
 
 ### Katamino 2.0 Game Desciption
 In our project, we plan to implement the original Katamino game with some added features and increase difficulty. This version of Katamino, would be both played as a single player or multiple player. When user plays as single player,different than the original Katamino we will increase difficulty by a time limit that affect the point gained when a level completed thus player has to hurry up to get maximum point. Every level comes with hints and a solution, these hints and solutions are available during the level but usage of hints and solutions will be punished by reducing the possible point that can be gained in the case of the complition of the level. By reducing the points we intend to user play carefully while our game will contaion a scoreboard with all top scores of the users. We will keep our users informations such as name, current level and top score. Players can play any level as long as they have completed all previous levels. We do not limit the user to just play the last level he/she is. We will use also differnt design for our board such as it is a continuos rectangle by showing a part of previous levels board.
There is multi-player option as well as the original Katamino has. In the multiplayer version, players take turns to place blocks in a rectangle area, the first player that fails to place a block to the rectangle area (due to the size or shape of the blocks) looses the game. In our version we will use diffent gameboards than the 64 square block one. Our gameboards will be shaped as interesting figures such as elefant, giraffe. By not limiting the board we will create different block figures to be used in the game.
